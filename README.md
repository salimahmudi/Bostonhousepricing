# Boston House Pricing Prediction

## Software and Tools Requirements

Before starting the project, ensure the following tools are installed:

1. **[GitHub Account](https://github.com)** - Manage your code repositories.
2. **[Heroku Account](https://heroku.com)** - Deploy the application.
3. **[VSCode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** - Recommended IDE for editing your code.
4. **[Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line)** - Command-line tool for Git operations.

## Project Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the **Boston House Pricing Project**.

### 1. Create a Conda Environment

```bash
conda activate development
```

Create a new Conda environment to manage project dependencies:

```bash
conda create -p venv python==3.7 -y
```

Explanation: This creates a virtual environment named `venv` with Python 3.7. The `-y` flag automatically confirms the installation.

### 2. Initialize Conda

Ensure Conda is properly initialized in your terminal:

```bash
conda init
```

Explanation: Initializes Conda in your shell. After running this command, restart the terminal.

### 3. Activate the Conda Environment

Activate the environment you created earlier:

```bash
conda activate C:\Users\salima\Desktop\Portfolio_Data_Analysis_Projects\Project4_EndToEndMachineLearningProject\housepricing\Bostonhousepricing\venv
conda activate C:\path\to\your\environment\venv
```

Explanation: Activates the `venv` environment. Replace the path with the correct location of your environment.

### 4. Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Explanation: Installs libraries such as Flask, sklearn, pandas, etc., that are required for the project.

### 5. Set Up Git with GitHub

If you're using Git for version control, configure Git with your GitHub credentials:

```bash
git config --global user.name "salimahmudi"
git config --global user.email "salimahammoudi2025@gmail.com"
```

Explanation: These commands set your username and email for Git commits.

### 6. Add Files to Git

Add the files you want to track with Git:

```bash
git add .
```

Explanation: Stages all files in the current directory for a commit. You can also specify files individually.

### 7. Check Git Status

Check the status of your Git repository before committing:

```bash
git status
```

Explanation: Shows which files have been modified or added and which are ready to commit.

### 8. Commit Your Changes to Git

Commit your changes with a message:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Explanation: Commits the changes with a descriptive message.

### 9. Push Code to GitHub

Push your local repository to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin master
git push origin main

```

Explanation: Pushes the `main` branch to your GitHub repository. Ensure the repository is already linked.

### 10. Run the Flask Application Locally

Start the Flask app:

```bash
flask run
```

Explanation: Runs the Flask development server. You can access the app locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 11. Deploy the Application to Heroku

Log in to your Heroku account:

```bash
heroku login
```

Explanation: Logs you into Heroku. A browser window will open for authentication.

### 12. Create a New Heroku App

Create a new Heroku app:

```bash
heroku create
```

Explanation: Creates a new app on Heroku. Heroku will assign a random name, or you can specify your own.

### 13. Push the Code to Heroku

Push your code to Heroku:

```bash
git push heroku main
```

Explanation: Pushes your code to Heroku for deployment. Heroku will detect the Python app and configure it automatically.

### 14. Open Your Application on Heroku

Once deployed, open your app in the browser:

```bash
heroku open
```

Explanation: Opens the deployed appâ€™s URL in your browser.
